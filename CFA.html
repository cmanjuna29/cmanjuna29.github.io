								<h2>Background</h2>
								<p align="justify">Zomato is an Indian multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company. It
									provides information about restaurants, average cost for two, cuisines served, ratings etc.
									The dataset used for analysis is picked up from kaggle.com. This analysis would be most
									suitable for foodies who are looking to explore cuisines from various cities of the world based
									on their budget.</p>
								
								<h2>Objective</h2>
								<p align="justify">To apply the concepts from Network Theory, Machine Learning and Optimization, and draw
									insights that would assist a person answer the following questions<br>
									<li>How to minimise the spending while visiting a set of predefined criteria of
										restaurants?</li>
									<li>What is the shortest path in which I can visit all the restaurants?</li>
									<li>If I plan to visit a particular restaurant, are there any other restaurants that I can visit
											on the way to minimise the travel time covering multiple restaurants?</li>
									<li>If a new restaurant was introduced in a particular city, what would be the average
										cost for two?</li>
									<li>If a new restaurant was introduced in a particular city, will the restaurant deliver
										food?</li>
									</p>
								<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
								<li>What is the mean, median, standard deviation of various attributes of data?</li><br>
								<img src="images/CFA01.png" width="800" height="200" alt=""> 
								<li>Are there null values in the dataset? There are only 9 null values in cuisines. Apart
									from that there are no null values.</li><br>
									<img src="images/CFA02.png" width="200" height="200" alt=""> 
								<li>How many restaurants are present for each country in the dataset? The dataset
									mostly contains restaurants from India.</li><br>
									<img src="images/CFA03.png" width="200" height="200" alt=""> <br>
								

								<h2>Application of conpects to Dataset</h2>
								<h3>Scenario</h3>
								<p align="justify">Let us imagine Adam - a foodie who recently started dating a girl and wants to take her out
									to restaurants in multiple cities. But he has no idea on where to start, how much it would cost
									etc. We will try to help him out through our analysis and provide insights so that he can
									impress her in the best way possible.</p>
								
								<h2>Optimization - Linear programming application</h2>
								<p align="justify">Adam is planning to take his girlfriend to Manchester but his girlfriend is pretty demanding
									and wants to go out on dates 20 times during their visit. But it doesn’t stop there as she has
									more specific demands:<br>
								<li>They should visit an European restaurant at least 8 times.</li>
								<li>They should visit a Fast Food restaurant at least 5 times.</li>
								<li>They should visit an Asian restaurant at least 4 times.</li>
								<li>They should have some other cuisine at least 2 times.</li>
								<li>They cannot visit the same restaurant more than 3 times.</li>
								<li>They cannot visit a restaurant with less than a 3.5 zomato rating.</li><br>
								Adam, who recently started working, does not have a lot of money and wants to spend as
								little as possible while satisfying all his girlfriend’s demands. How can Adam achieve this?<br>
								Let's look at the data snapshot
								<img src="images/CFA04.png" width="800" height="400" alt=""> 
								We preprocessed the data to split the cuisines into multiple columns and then created
								dummy columns to indicate the type of cuisine served by them.<br>
								<img src="images/CFA05.png" width="800" height="400" alt=""> <br>
								Using the pulp package in python the problem is formulated<br>
								<img src="images/CFA06.png" width="800" height="200" alt=""> <br>
								<img src="images/CFA07.png" width="800" height="250" alt=""> <br>
								The solution for this problem is<br>
								<img src="images/CFA08.png" width="400" height="300" alt=""> <br>
								Adam would need to visit ‘The Grill on Alley’ 2 times, ‘Solita’ 2 times, ‘Almost Famous
								Burgers’ 3 times, ‘Home Sweet Home’ 3 times, ‘Teacup’ 2 times, ‘Lahore’ 3 times, ‘Akbars’
								1 time and ‘San Carlo’ 3 times to minimise the cost.
								The minimum amount that Adam would end up spending is 690 pounds.<br>
								Output from Linear optimizer:<br>

								</p>
								
								
								<h3>Application of Graph Theory</h3>
								<h4>Scenario 1</h4>
								<p align="justify">Adam with his girlfriend plans to visit Mumbai for a week-long trip. He decides
									to take her out to one restaurant each day. Adam wants to know if there are any other
									restaurants closer than the restaurant of interest in the same path he would take so that he
									can pay a visit to the closer restaurant than the one intended and reduce the expenditure on
									Uber.<br>
									To answer Adam’s question, we use the following subset data.<br>
									<img src="images/CFA10.png" width="400" height="300" alt=""> <br>
									To detect the current location of Adam, we have to input the city, longitude and latitude.
									Using the Longitude and Latitude the distance from one restaurant to every other restaurant
									is computed. Using distance as weight, a network is created.<br>
									<img src="images/CFA11.png" width="600" height="400" alt=""> <br>
									Using the single source dijkstra algorithm we can find the shortest distance from Adam’s
									current location to the restaurant of interest. If there are any other restaurants in the same
									path, and are closer, the algorithm will return the values.
									<img src="images/CFA12.png" width="400" height="300" alt=""> <br>
									<img src="images/CFA13.png" width="400" height="400" alt=""> <br>
								</p>


								<h4>Scenario 2</h4>
								
								<p align="justify">Adam and his girlfriend both have a sweet tooth. They decided to visit all
									restaurants in Mumbai which serves ‘Desserts’, using the Zomato database as a reference
									on a given day.They want to stop at their Hotel once to take a nap in between. How can they
									minimise their uber expenses<br>
									<img src="images/CFA14.png" width="400" height="400" alt=""> <br>

									Using graph analytics, we can solve this by approximating the problem to a travelling
									salesman problem.<br>
									The optimal path from the analysis is:<br>
									<img src="images/CFA15.png" width="1000" height="40" alt=""> <br>
								</p>
								
								<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
								<h3>Objective</h3>
								<p align="justify">To predict the “average cost for two” given the location, ratings, votes, table
									bookings, delivery options etc. Prediction is made on the subset data filtering for India as the
									country.</p>
								<h4>Relationship check with the target variable</h4>
								<li>Scatter plot for votes vs average cost for two</li><br>
								<img src="images/CFA16.png" width="400" height="300" alt=""> <br>
								<li>Scatter plot for ratings vs average cost for two</li><br>
								<img src="images/CFA17.png" width="400" height="300" alt=""> <br>
								<p align="justify"></p>>Since categorical variables are present, dummy columns were created to encode the values.The dataset is split into 70% train and 30% test.The Xgboost package is used to make predictions. Since this algorithm can run in parallel,
									we use thread = 4. Grid search methodology is used to find the best combination of
									hyperparameters for the model.The best estimated parameters for the model are selected as shown below. Some of the
									important selected parameters are Max_depth = 256, n_estimators = 55, learning_rate=0.1.<br>
									Xgboost model was fit using the best params from the grid search. The model achieved an
									r-sq of 55.37% on the test dataset.
								</p>
								
								<h4>Visualising feature importance:</h4>
								<img src="images/CFA18.png" width="400" height="200" alt=""> <br>
								<p align="justify">From the graph, we can see that the longitude and latitude, Votes and aggregate rating are
								the most important features in the model.</p>
								

								<h2>Application of Decision Trees</h2>
								<h3>Objective : To predict if a restaurant present in a certain location has a home delivery service
									or not.</h3>
								<p align="justify">
									If Adam finds a new restaurant other than the ones in the list of restaurants present in the
									dataset, and is unsure if the restaurant has delivery service or not, the prediction made here
									will come in handy for Adam to plan a visit or order food accordingly.</p><br>

								<h3>Data Exploration</h3>
								<img src="images/CFA19.png" width="400" height="200" alt=""> <br>
								<p align="justify">We can see that the Average Cost for two is an important differentiator for understanding
									whether a restaurant will deliver or not</p>
								<img src="images/CFA20.png" width="400" height="200" alt=""> <br>
								<p align="justify">From the above graph we can see that Votes is an important differentiator for understanding
									whether a restaurant will deliver or not</p>
								
								<h3>Model Building</h3>
								
								<p><li>Data Treatment: We use a subset of data i.e., by filter for India as a country to make
									predictions.</li>
									<li>Data Split: Split the dataset to 90% train and 10% test</li>
									<li>Used one hot encoding to treat the categorical variables</li>
									<li>Used grid search the find the optimal parameters for the model using AUC-ROC as
										the primary metric</li>
									<li>Constructed the decision tree using the optimal parameters. The optimal parameters
										are (max_depth - 6, n_estimators=30, learning_rate=0.3)</li>
								</p>
								<h3>Model Results</h3>
								<h4>Confusion Matrix</h4>
								<img src="images/CFA21.png" width="400" height="200" alt=""> <br>
								<p align="justify">The Recall for the model is 0.7787, so our model is able to identify ~78% of the restaurants
									offering online delivery. But the precision is low at 0.4987, which means almost half of the
									restaurants which the model predicts as delivering online are not true.</p>
								<h4>Plotting ROC and AUC curve</h4>
								<img src="images/CFA22.png" width="400" height="200" alt=""> <br>
								<h4>Decision Tree Plot</h4>
								<img src="images/CFA23.png" width="600" height="300" alt=""> <br>
								<p>The leaf (highlighted in red box) has the highest share of online deliveries. This leaf can be
									reached by partitioning the data on the basis of:</p>
								<img src="images/CFA24.png" width="800" height="40" alt=""> <br>
								<h2>Conclusion</h2>
								<p align="justify">Using the optimization and prediction method suggested above, Adam successfully could
									meet his girlfriend’s demands as well as save money by optimally spending on restaurants
									and Uber. Also, the suggestions made by graphs, helped Adam to impress his girlfriend with
									smart recommendations and further strengthened their bonding.</p>
