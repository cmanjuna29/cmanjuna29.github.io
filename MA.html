								<h2>Objective</h2>
								<p align="justify">To understand the characteristic features of customers, their purchase behaviour and the impact of iFood’s marketing activities.</p>
								
								<img src="images/MA01.png" width="1000" height="300" alt=""> <br>
								<h2>Current Business Scenario</h2><br>
								<img src="images/MA02.png" width="1000" height="300" alt=""> <br>
								<p align="justify"><li>Volume of the store purchases is more than 1.4 times that of web purchases
								</li><br>
								<li>Wine is the most preferred item
								</li>
									</p>
								<h2>Customer Characteristics </h2><br>

								<h2>Purchase Behaviour - I</h2>
								
								
									<img src="images/MA05.png" width="400" height="300" alt=""><br>
									<p align="justify">As age increases, there is an initial drop in sales followed by a rise</p><br>
									<p align="justify">
									On conducting a hypothesis testing:<br>
									H0: Sales are not impacted by age of customer<br>
									H1: Sales are impacted by age of customer<br>
									We get a p-value of 2.48e-08, which means we have enough statistical evidence to reject  the null hypothesis and conclude that sales are impacted by age
									 </p>

								<h2>Purchase Behaviour - II</h2>
								
								
										 <img src="images/MA06.png" width="400" height="300" alt=""> <br>
										 <p align="justify">Customers with higher income tend to order for more amount</p><br>
									 	<p align="justify">
										On conducting a hypothesis testing:<br>
										H0: Sales are not impacted by income of customer<br>
										H1: Sales are impacted by income of customer<br>
										We get a p-value < 2e-16, which means we have enough statistical evidence to reject  the null hypothesis and conclude that sales are impacted by income<br>

										  </p>
								<h2>Purchase Behaviour - III</h2>
								
									
										<img src="images/MA07.png" width="400" height="300" alt=""> <br>
										<p align="justify">Customers without kids order for 4.7 times the amount as ones with kids</p><br>
										<p align="justify">
										On conducting a hypothesis testing:<br>
										H0: Customers without kids do not spend more than customers with kids<br>
										H1: Customers without kids spend more than customers with kids<br>
										We get a p-value < 2e-16, which means we have enough statistical evidence to reject  the null hypothesis and conclude that customer without kids spend more than customers with kids<br>

								<h3>Factors Affecting Campaign Effectiveness</h3>
								
								Identifying factors impacting customers’ propensity to accept a campaign:
								<li>Model: Random Forest Classifier</li>
								<li>Major Factors Identified: Recency of Purchase, Past campaign acceptance, Customer Lifetime</li>
								<img src="images/MA08.png" width="400" height="300" alt=""> <br>
								<b>On average, the customers who accepted campaigns in the past also showed tendency of accepting the current campaign. </b>
								<img src="images/MA09.png" width="400" height="300" alt=""> <br>
								<b>Customers who accepted the campaign have higher customer lifetime.</b><br>
								<img src="images/MA10.png" width="400" height="300" alt=""> <br>
								<b>Campaign acceptance higher with customers who have made a more recent purchase.</b><br>



								
								<h2>Customer Segments</h2>

								<img src="images/MA11.png" width="400" height="300" alt=""> <br>
								<p align="justify">4 Customer segments were created using K-means on customer’s Order Recency, Frequency and Amount Spent<br>

									Understanding the demographics and purchase behaviors of these segments will help iFood target them better.
